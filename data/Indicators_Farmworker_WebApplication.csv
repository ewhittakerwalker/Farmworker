The drinking water contaminant index is a combination of contaminant data that takes into account the relative concentrations of different contaminants and whether multiple contaminants are present in public drinking water systems and groundwater from 2011-2019. Sources of data include Safe Drinking Water Information System, EDT Library and Water Quality Analyses Data and California State Water Resources Control Board. See Cal Enviro Screen 4.0 report for more details.
