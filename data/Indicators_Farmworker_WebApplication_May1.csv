Median household income divied by median value of owner occupied dwellings. ACS caps home prices at $1,000,001, but not provide a margin of error (MOE) for tracts where this was done. We calculated the average MOE for tracts with median home prices ranging from $900-999,000, and assigned that MOE to tracts with median home values over $1 million.
